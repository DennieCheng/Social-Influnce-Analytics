The goal of this analytics is to analyze the data for potential insight to inform a “free-to-fee” strategy for High Note.
(High Note is a music streaming company --- similar to Last.fm, Spotify or Pandora --- that uses a freemium business model - divides user populations into groups that use the service for free and groups that pay a fee for additional features.)
