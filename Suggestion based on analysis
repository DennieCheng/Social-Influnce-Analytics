“Free to Fee” Strategies:

Based on the fact of a High Note paid subscriber is 24-time more profitable than a free user, our goal is increasing the number of subscribers who use the music premium service.
According to part 3 and part 4 analysis, we learned “having subscriber friends” has strong positive treatment effect on a user who is probably going to subscribe premium service (the odds of premium subscription would increase by 127% on average if a user has subscriber friends), and, the number of subscriber friends a user having also impacts the most on making decision for premium subscription. Besides, it is learned from regression model in part 4 that when a user’s activities of using High Note change from shouts only to perform more on listening songs or marking loved tracks, the probability of subscription changes from negative to positive. That means if a user explored more deeply on the music platform and engaged more in the community of the music platform, the higher probability the user subscribes premium service.
Therefore, for achieving the goal, we should focus on increasing the number of subscriber friends for both premium users and free users, and also attracting users to engage more deeply on the music app/website. 
Detailed strategy is following,
1.	For free-account users having no subscriber friend:
•	Make hot music which have a lot of comments from subscribers more salient on the user interface. The comments, which has implied music platform features only subscribers can use, should be salient as well. This will attract free-account users to explore more of the music platform and engage more activities.
•	If a subscriber is friend of a free-account user’s friend, then make this subscriber’s activity more salient.
2.	For free-account users having subscriber friends:
•	Give incentive for subscribers who successfully referred the premium service to a free-account user. And the user who converted from free-account also can get incentive from this referral.
•	Make their subscriber friends’ activities more salient for free-account users, especially the subscriber friends have the similar demographic features with them. And encourage their interaction by designing platform features.
3.	Based on free-account users’ segments, attract them transfer to premium accounts by following:
•	Advertise premium trial to free-account users at age 20-40 to let them explore more, especially in non-US/UK/ED countries and to male users. When the trial is expiring, offer discount for one-year subscription (not pay monthly).
•	More product types: student-account for young people below 25; family-account with discount for several people as a household subscribing together.
•	Joint-account with other popular online streaming services, like paying a premium price for both High Note premium service and Netflix online movie service.
•	Push customized music content to attract potential subscribers by analyzing users’ profile introduction. For example, a free-account user’s introduction states she is a new mom, then the platform can push music for baby sleeping.
4.	To keep subscriber staying with the service,
•	Push customized music content by analyzing the music taste of the subscribers and their users and friends of the similar demographic feature, like Spotify’s Discover Weekly.
•	Suggest to add friends(subscribers) who have similar music tastes.
•	Build attractive community for subscribers, like Yelp’s Elite Squad. To build a High Note Elite team and engage elite subscribers online and offline.
•	By optimizing APP/Website design, make subscribers’ activities more salient and easier to get others comments.
